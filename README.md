###Introduction:###

Inspired by Johnny Thunders ["You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory"]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0_2aWbOmJc&spfreload=10), Thundrs is a
respository to digitalize the memories you no longer put your hands around
either.

###Concept:###

Not just a photo pail but a place to reconnect with nostalgia and shared memories
 from someone you might have ecountered at a concert 20 years ago and never forgot.

###Version 2:###

Originally **[Thundrs](https://github.com/trendwithin/thundrs)** was designed
and implemented in 4 days as a class assignment.  While satisfied with the level
or work achieved within this period, the short duration left the final product
unpolished and a list of future features incomplete.
